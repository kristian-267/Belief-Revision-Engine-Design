# Belief-Revision-Engine-Design

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the development of a Belief Revision Engine, an essential component in Artificial Intelligence for updating beliefs when presented with new evidence. It's implemented in Python and based on the AGM (Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson) postulates.

## Files
- `scripts/main.py`: Main script demonstrating the use of belief revision functions.
- `scripts/beliefbase.py`: Defines the structure and operations of the belief base.
- `scripts/functions.py`: Contains auxiliary functions for belief revision.
- `scripts/agm_test.py`: Implements tests for the AGM belief revision functions.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kristian-267/Belief-Revision-Engine-Design.git
cd Belief-Revision-Engine-Design
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run `scripts/main.py` to see a demonstration of belief revision in action. Modify it to test different belief scenarios.
